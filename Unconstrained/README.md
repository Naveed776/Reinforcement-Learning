### Detailed Performance Trends:

- **Early Iterations (1-5):** 
  - Saw gradual increase in episode reward mean and variability in value loss.
- **Mid Iterations (6-10):** 
  - Continued increase in episode reward mean with fluctuating training metrics.
- **Later Iterations (11-15):** 
  - Marked by further improvements in episode rewards and adjustments in training metrics.
- **Final Iterations (16-22):** 
  - Peaked in episode reward mean at 12.3, with reduced KL divergence and varied value loss indicating model convergence.
