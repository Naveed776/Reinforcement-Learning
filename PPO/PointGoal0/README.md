# Summary of Episodes' Return and Cost
The episode returns and costs provided can be analyzed to determine the average return, variability, and other statistics. Here’s a summary of the data for the 25 episodes:

The data represents the outcomes of multiple episodes in a simulation or reinforcement learning scenario, where each episode yields a return (reward) and has no associated cost.

Return (Reward):

The returns vary between episodes, ranging from a minimum of 19.060 to a maximum of 29.643.
The average return across all episodes appears to be moderately high, suggesting consistent or improving performance.
Episode Cost:

Each episode lists a cost of 0, indicating no additional expenses or penalties incurred during the simulations.
Observations:

The returns fluctuate around a certain mean value, indicating stable performance with occasional variations.
Episodes such as the 14th and 25th exhibit lower returns compared to others, which might indicate challenges or specific conditions in those episodes.
Overall, the returns suggest a successful performance in achieving the simulation's objectives without notable costs or penalties.
This summary encapsulates the key points from the provided episode data, highlighting the range and consistency of returns observed across the simulation episodes
